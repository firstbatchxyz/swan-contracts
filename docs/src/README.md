# Swan Protocol
Swan is a **Decentralized Protocol** where AI agents (buyers) dynamically interact with asset creators. Agents operate with budgets to purchase assets that match their objectives. Asset creators design assets to align with buyersâ€™ needs to convince the LLM to buy their asset/assets.

## Compile

Compile the contracts with:

```sh
forge clean && forge build
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Openzeppelin' foundry modules expect that running `forge clean` before running Foundry script or test or include `--force` option when running `forge script` or `forge test`.

## Test

Run tests on local:

```sh
forge clean && forge test
```

or on any other evm chain:

```sh
forge clean && forge test --rpc-url <RPC_URL>
```

## Deployment

**Step 1.**
Import your `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` to env file.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Foundry expects the API key to be defined as `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` even though you're using another explorer.

**Step 2.**
Create keystores for deployment. [See more for keystores](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2335)

```sh
cast wallet import <FILE_NAME_OF_YOUR_KEYSTORE> --interactive
```
You can see your wallets with:

```sh
cast wallet list
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Recommended to create keystores on directly on your shell.
> You HAVE to type your password on the terminal to be able to use your keys. (e.g when deploying a contract)

**Step 3.**
Enter your private key (associated with your address) and password on terminal. You'll see your address on terminal.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you want to deploy contracts on localhost please provide local address for the command above.

**Step 4.**
Deploy the contract with:

```sh
forge clean && forge script ./script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy<CONTRACT_NAME> --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --account <FILE_NAME_OF_YOUR_KEYSTORE> --sender <DEPLOYER_ADDRESS> --broadcast
```
or for instant verification use:

```sh
forge clean && forge script ./script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --account <FILE_NAME_OF_YOUR_KEYSTORE> --sender <DEPLOYER_ADDRESS> --broadcast --verify --verifier <etherscan|blockscout|sourcify> --verifier-url <VERIFIER_URL>
```

> [!NOTE]
> `<VERIFIER_URL>` should be expolorer's homepage url. Forge reads your `<ETHERSCAN_API_KEY>` from .env file so you don't need to add this at the end of `<VERIFIER_URL>`.
>
> e.g. 
> `https://base-sepolia.blockscout.com/api/` for `Base Sepolia Network`
>

You can see deployed contract addresses under the `deployment/<chainid>.json`

## Verify Contract

Verify contract manually with:

```sh
forge verify-contract <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> src/$<CONTRACT_NAME>.sol:<CONTRACT_NAME> --verifier <etherscan|blockscout|sourcify> --verifier-url <VERIFIER_URL>
```

## Coverage

Check coverages with:

```sh
forge clean && bash coverage.sh
```
or to see summarized coverages on terminal:

```sh
forge clean && forge coverage --no-match-coverage "(test|mock|script)"
```

You can see coverages under the coverage directory.

## Storage Layout

Get storage layout with:

```sh
forge clean && bash storage.sh
```

You can see storage layouts under the storage directory.

## Gas Snapshot

Take the gas snapshot with:

```sh
forge clean && forge snapshot
```

You can see the snapshot `.gas-snapshot` file in the current directory.

## Format

Format code with:

```sh
forge fmt
```

## Generate documentation

Generate documentation with:

```sh
forge doc
```

## Update

Update modules with:

```sh
forge update
```

You can see the documentation under the `docs/` directory.
